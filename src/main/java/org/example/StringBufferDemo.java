/**Comparison between String Buffer and String Builder in Java

 1.Basic
 String Buffer: - Introduced with the initial release of Java.
 String Builder: - Introduced in Java 5.
 2.Synchronized
 String Buffer: - It is synchronized.
 String Builder: - It is not synchronized.
 3.Performance
 String Buffer: - It is thread-safe, so multiple threads canâ€™t access it at the same time; therefore, it is slow.
 String Builder: - It is not thread-safe, hence faster than String Buffer.
 4.Mutable
 Both are mutable and allow modification of strings without creating an object string.
 5. Storage
 The storage for both is on the Heap.*/
