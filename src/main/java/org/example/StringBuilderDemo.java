/**Comparison between String Buffer and String Builder in Java

        1.Basic
String Buffer: Introduced with the initial release of Java.
String Builder: Introduced in Java 5.
2.Synchronized
String Buffer: It is synchronized.
String Builder: It is not synchronized.
3.Performance
String Buffer: It is thread-safe, so multiple threads canâ€™t access it at the same time; therefore, it is slow.
String Builder: It is not thread-safe, hence faster than String Buffer.
        4.Mutable
Both are mutable and allow modification of strings without creating an object string.
       5. Storage
The storage for both is on the Heap.*/
