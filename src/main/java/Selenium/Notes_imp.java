    /*A Proxy server is a fake server but the browser going to believe that it is an original domain server*/
    /**A proxy server acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. Hereâ€™s how it works:
     Traffic Routing: Instead of directly connecting to a website or service, your request passes through the proxy server first. For example, when you search on Google, the request goes through the proxy to Google and back.
     Types of Proxies:
     Forward Proxy: Routes your request to the intended domain, adding an extra layer of anonymity.
     Reverse Proxy: Works in the opposite direction, handling requests from external clients to internal servers1.
     Benefits:
     Anonymity: Hides your IP address.
     Content Control: Filters content.
     Speed: Caches data for faster browsing2.
     Remember, proxies are useful for privacy, security, and performance! ðŸ˜Š */
